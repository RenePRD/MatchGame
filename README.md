# MatchGame

MatchGame is a memory-based matching game developed in **C#** using the **.NET Framework 4.7.2** and designed with **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)**.
The game provides an interactive 4x4 grid where players click on tiles to reveal hidden animal emoji pairs, aiming to match all pairs as quickly as possible.
It features a built-in timer to track the player's performance and a restart option for replayability. The project is built using **Visual Studio**, leveraging its robust tools for XAML-based UI design and debugging.
MatchGame demonstrates core programming concepts such as event-driven programming, data binding, and UI/UX design principles in WPF.
